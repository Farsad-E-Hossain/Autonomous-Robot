# Autonomous-Robot
This repository contains all the code, configuration files, and resources needed to build and operate an autonomous robot. The robot is capable of navigating environments, avoiding obstacles, and performing tasks without human intervention. It combines sensors, microcontrollers, and control algorithms to make real-time decisions.
